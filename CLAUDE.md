# CLAUDE.md — SiftStack

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**SiftStack** — Full-stack real estate investing operations platform built around DataSift.ai CRM. Covers the entire REI business lifecycle:

1. **Data Acquisition:** Web scraping tnpublicnotice.com (foreclosures, tax sales, probates), scanned PDF import, courthouse terminal photo import (probate, eviction, code violations, divorce), Dropbox auto-polling
2. **Enrichment Pipeline:** 10+ steps — Smarty address standardization, Zillow property data, Knox County Tax API, obituary/heir research, Ancestry.com SSDI, Tracerfy skip trace, Trestle phone scoring, entity research
3. **Deal Analysis:** Comparable sales (Two-Bucket ARV), rehab estimation (4-tier room-by-room), deal analyzer (MAO/ROI/financing scenarios)
4. **Market Intelligence:** Zip code scoring, Market Finder reports, cash buyer list building, investor portfolio analysis
5. **CRM Automation:** DataSift upload, 26 TCA sequence templates, 12 niche sequential marketing presets, filter preset management, SiftMap sold property tagging
6. **Lead Management:** 4 Pillars of Motivation auto-qualification, STABM daily routine, pipeline reporting, deep prospecting (4-level framework)
7. **Operations:** Acquisition playbook generator (SOPs, scripts, checklists), Slack/Discord notifications, Google Drive upload, Apify Actor deployment

Currently focused on Knox and Blount counties, Tennessee.

8. **REI Skill Library:** 13 Claude Co-Work skill files (`.skill`/`.plugin` ZIPs) for distribution to DataSift community via [learn.datasift.ai/claude-skills-rei](https://learn.datasift.ai/claude-skills-rei). Skills teach Claude specific REI workflows when uploaded to Co-Work sessions or Projects.

## Architecture

**Data flows:**
- **Web scrape:** `main.py` → `scraper.py` → `captcha_solver.py` → `notice_parser.py` + `foreclosure_filter.py` → enrichment → CSV
- **PDF import:** `main.py` → `pdf_importer.py` (pypdfium2 → `image_utils.py` OCR) → enrichment → CSV
- **Photo import:** `main.py` → `photo_importer.py` (OpenCV → `image_utils.py` OCR → `llm_parser.py`) → enrichment → CSV
- **Dropbox watch:** `dropbox_watcher.py` → `photo_importer.py` → enrichment → CSV (auto-polling loop)
- **Market Finder:** `extract_market_finder.py` → DataSift Market Finder (Playwright) → paginate all ZIP + neighborhood data → JSON → `generate_knox_report.py` → 7-sheet Excel

- **main.py** — CLI entry point. Parses args (`daily`/`historical`, `--split`, `--counties`, `--types`, `-v`). Filters saved searches by county/type, orchestrates scrape → dedup → export, logs run summary stats.
- **scraper.py** — Playwright browser automation. Reuses saved session cookies when possible, falls back to fresh login. Selects each saved search from the Smart Search dropdown (triggers ASP.NET postback), paginates results (50/page max), clicks each View button to open notice detail pages. Uses `last_run.json` for daily mode state, `cookies.json` for session persistence.
- **captcha_solver.py** — Solves reCAPTCHA v2 via **2Captcha API** on every notice detail page. Sends websiteURL + sitekey, gets back a `g-recaptcha-response` token, injects it, clicks "View Notice". Retries up to 3 times. This is the primary bottleneck (~10-30s per notice).
- **notice_parser.py** — Extracts structured fields from raw notice text using regex. There are NO structured HTML fields on the site — address, owner, dates are all embedded in free-text notice bodies. Defines the `NoticeData` dataclass used throughout.
- **foreclosure_filter.py** — Filters foreclosure search results to only keep real first-to-market trustee sales. Matches against observed title variations (substitute/successor trustee sales). Non-foreclosure notice types pass through unfiltered.
- **data_formatter.py** — Deduplicates by address (keeps most recent), then converts `NoticeData` list to Sift upload CSV. Split mode produces `{county}_{type}_{timestamp}.csv` files.
- **config.py** — Credentials (from `.env`), ASP.NET element selectors, saved search definitions, rate limiting constants, paths, image processing thresholds.
- **image_utils.py** — Shared OCR utilities used by both `pdf_importer.py` and `photo_importer.py`. Exports `fix_rotation()` (Tesseract OSD) and `ocr_page(image, psm)` with configurable page segmentation mode. Handles Tesseract binary detection.
- **photo_importer.py** — Courthouse phone photo import. OpenCV preprocessing chain (EXIF transpose → blur check → bilateral filter → perspective correction → Otsu threshold) → Tesseract OCR (PSM 4) → LLM parsing → NoticeData. Supports all 7 notice types.
- **dropbox_watcher.py** — Cursor-based Dropbox folder polling. Downloads new photos, resolves county + notice_type from folder path (`/Knox/eviction/photo.jpg`), processes through photo_importer, deletes from Dropbox after success. State persisted to `dropbox_state.json` + `photo_state.json`.
- **report_generator.py** — Generates per-record PDF deep prospecting reports using reportlab. Includes property summary, signing chain with phone tiers, valuation, deceased owner detection. Output to `output/reports/`.
- **extract_market_finder.py** — Playwright automation to extract ALL ZIP code + neighborhood data from DataSift Market Finder. Handles styled-component dropdowns, pagination (20 rows/page), Beamer popup dismissal. Outputs JSON. See "Market Finder Extraction Patterns" below.
- **market_analyzer.py** — ZIP code scoring engine. 6-factor weighted composite (Distress 30%, Value 20%, Equity 15%, Tax Delinquency 15%, Competition 10%, DOM 10%). Grades A/B/C/D, budget allocation across top ZIPs. Reads from scraped notice CSVs in `output/`.
- **drive_uploader.py** — Google Drive upload via service account. `upload_file()` (generic, returns webViewLink) and `upload_csv()` (CSV-specific, returns file ID).

## Site-Specific Details

The site is **ASP.NET WebForms** — all navigation uses `__doPostBack()` with ViewState. Session IDs are embedded in URL paths (`/(S({guid}))/`). Playwright is required because direct HTTP requests would need to manage ViewState/EventValidation manually.

**reCAPTCHA v2 is required on every single notice detail page**, even when logged in. There is no CAPTCHA on login, search, or results pages. The sitekey is hardcoded in `config.py`.

## Saved Searches

8 searches defined in `config.py` as `SAVED_SEARCHES`. Each maps to an exact dropdown option name on the Smart Search dashboard:
- Knox & Blount × (Foreclosure V2, Tax Sale V2, Tax Delinquent V2, Probate V2)

Filterable via `--counties` and `--types` CLI args (comma-separated, or omit for all).

## Key Domain Rules

- **Foreclosure filtering is critical.** Not all notices from "Foreclosure" saved searches are actual foreclosures. The scraper parses each notice's full text and only includes ones with trustee sale language. See `INCLUDE_PHRASES` / `EXCLUDE_PHRASES` in `foreclosure_filter.py`.
- **Probate owner_name** should be the Personal Representative/Executor/Administrator — not the deceased.
- **Owner names** in foreclosure notices typically appear after "executed by" in the deed of trust language.
- **Rate limiting:** 2-3 second random delays between requests, 3 retries per page.
- **Address dedup:** Same property can appear in multiple notices; `data_formatter.deduplicate()` keeps the most recent.

## Output

CSV files land in `output/` (gitignored). Logs go to `logs/` with timestamped filenames. Sift columns: `date_added, address, city, state, zip, owner_name, notice_type, county, source_url`.

**Date Semantics (build 1.0.30+):** `date_added` = the date WE added the record (the pipeline run date, stamped in `run_enrichment_pipeline`), so a daily run shows today. The legal notice's publication date lives in its own field/column, `date_published` / "Notice Publish Date" (parsed by `notice_parser` / the scraper results grid). PDF/photo imports set `date_added` explicitly (preserved, not re-stamped); CSV re-import preserves both columns. Downstream that needs the filing date (DOD sanity check, DataSift Probate Open Date, the month tag, dedup tie-break) uses `date_published` (fallback `date_added`).

## Notice Screenshots (proof-of-source)

Each scraped notice gets a full-page screenshot of its detail page on tnpublicnotice.com, captured the moment the reCAPTCHA is solved and the legal notice is visible (`notice_screenshot.py::capture_notice_screenshot`, called from `scraper.py` in the kept-notice branch). The image is the actual published notice, used to add legitimacy to outreach.

- **Scope:** foreclosures only by default (`config.NOTICE_SCREENSHOT_TYPES`, comma-separated env override). Toggle the whole feature with `CAPTURE_NOTICE_SCREENSHOTS` (default on). Capture is best-effort: a screenshot failure never drops the record. PNGs land in `output/notices/` (gitignored), named `notice_{ID}.png` by the numeric notice ID.
- **Carried on `NoticeData`:** `notice_screenshot_path` (local PNG, set at scrape) → `notice_screenshot_url` (hosted link, set at output time).
- **Hosting:** Apify run pushes each PNG to the key-value store and sets a shareable URL (mirrors the deep-prospecting PDF pattern). CLI run uploads to Google Drive when `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` + `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` are set, else falls back to the local path. Helpers: `host_screenshots_via_drive()`, `set_local_screenshot_urls()`.
- **Delivery to DataSift:** the URL rides along as the `Notice Screenshot` custom field plus a "Notice Screenshot:" line in record Notes (`datasift_formatter`). DataSift's CSV upload cannot push an image into the REISift Gallery panel, so the link is the supported route.

## Scraping Backend: Scrapfly (build 1.0.31+)

The gated notice detail fetch (the "caps structure": residential proxy, anti-bot, reCAPTCHA, and the proof-of-source screenshot) can run through the **Scrapfly API** instead of the in-house Playwright + 2Captcha path. Selected by `SCRAPE_BACKEND` (defaults to `scrapfly` when `SCRAPFLY_KEY` is set, otherwise `playwright`).

- **`scrapfly_client.py`** provides `ScrapflyNoticeClient`. `login(session)` logs into Smart Search inside a Scrapfly session (forms-auth cookie + sticky residential IP), then `fetch_notice(id, session)` opens the detail page with `asp=True` + `render_js=True`, a JS scenario clicks "View Notice" (ASP solves the reCAPTCHA), and it returns rendered HTML + a full-page screenshot in one call. `fetch_notices(ids)` logs in once and yields a result per ID. Best-effort with retries; every call returns a `NoticeFetchResult`.
- **Scraper integration** (`scraper.py`): when `SCRAPE_BACKEND == "scrapfly"`, Playwright still drives login + saved-search navigation and supplies each notice ID, but the per-notice content + screenshot come from Scrapfly via `_scrapfly_notice()`. Any Scrapfly failure falls back to the 2Captcha path, so the swap is safe. Returned HTML is parsed by `notice_parser.parse_notice_html()` (shares field extraction with `parse_notice_page`).
- **Screenshots** come natively from Scrapfly (`screenshots={'notice': 'fullpage'}`), saved to `output/notices/` and hosted/linked exactly like the Playwright path.
- **Tooling:** `scrapfly_spike.py --id <id>` validates one notice (gate clears + screenshot) before relying on it. `backfill_screenshots.py [--csv ...]` logs in once and backfills screenshots for a master list (e.g. the output of `consolidate_foreclosures.py`), writing `notice_screenshot_path` / `notice_screenshot_url` back to the CSV.
- **Env:** `SCRAPFLY_KEY` (required), `SCRAPE_BACKEND`, `SCRAPFLY_COUNTRY` (default `us`), `SCRAPFLY_RENDER_WAIT_MS`, `SCRAPFLY_TIMEOUT_MS`, `SCRAPFLY_MAX_RETRIES`. Needs `scrapfly-sdk` (in requirements.txt).
- **Open validation:** whether Scrapfly's ASP clears this site's in-page reCAPTCHA "View Notice" gate is confirmed per-notice by the spike. A `gate_not_cleared` result means the JS scenario action schema or an explicit CAPTCHA step needs a tweak.

## Foreclosure Master List Consolidation (build 1.0.31+)

`consolidate_foreclosures.py` builds a master list of still-active foreclosures from the last N months of runs. It pulls each Apify run's `output.csv` from the run's key-value store (the default dataset is unused), merges local `output/` CSVs, dedupes by **property** (address + city, keeping the latest sale date so republished/postponed notices collapse to one), and removes any whose `auction_date` ("option date") has already passed. Needs `APIFY_TOKEN`. Output: `output/foreclosure_master_active_<date>.csv`.

```bash
python src/consolidate_foreclosures.py --months 3                  # Apify + local
python src/consolidate_foreclosures.py --months 3 --require-sale-date  # drop no-date junk
python src/consolidate_foreclosures.py --county Knox --no-apify     # local only, one county
```

## Apify Deployment

The project runs as an **Apify Actor** in the cloud. When `APIFY_IS_AT_HOME` or `APIFY_TOKEN` is set, `main.py` uses the Actor SDK instead of CLI args.

```bash
# Install Apify CLI
npm install -g apify-cli

# Local test (reads input.json, simulates Actor environment)
apify run --purge

# Deploy to Apify platform
apify login
apify push

# On Apify Console: set up daily schedule and configure secrets in Actor input
```

### Actor Input (configured in Apify Console or `input.json`)
- `mode`: "daily" or "historical"
- `counties` / `types`: arrays to filter saved searches (empty = all)
- `tn_username`, `tn_password`, `captcha_api_key`: secrets (required)
- `google_drive_folder_id`, `google_service_account_key`: optional Google Drive upload

### Actor Output
- **Dataset**: structured records pushed via `Actor.push_data()`
- **Key-value store**: `output.csv` backup
- **Google Drive** (optional): CSV + summary text file uploaded via service account

### Key Files
- `.actor/actor.json` — Actor manifest (name, version, Dockerfile path)
- `.actor/input_schema.json` — Input fields + validation for Apify Console UI
- `Dockerfile` — Based on `apify/actor-python-playwright:3.12`
- `src/drive_uploader.py` — Google Drive upload via base64-encoded service account key
- `input.json` — Local test input (gitignored, contains credentials)

## Courthouse Photo Pipeline (build 1.0.28+)

Courthouse terminal photos → OCR → LLM parse → enrichment → DataSift. Runner takes phone photos at Knox/Blount county terminals, uploads to Dropbox organized as `{county}/{notice_type}/`, system auto-processes.

### Notice Types (7 total)
- `foreclosure`, `tax_sale`, `tax_delinquent`, `probate` — existing from web scraper
- `eviction` — plaintiff = landlord (target contact), defendant = tenant
- `code_violation` — owner of record, violation type, compliance deadline
- `divorce` — petitioner + respondent, property from schedule page

### Critical OCR Patterns (hard-won from live testing)

**Moire pattern from terminal screens is the #1 OCR killer.** Standard Tesseract preprocessing (adaptive threshold, CLAHE) produces garbage on courthouse terminal photos. The fix:
- **Bilateral filter** (`cv2.bilateralFilter(gray, 15, 75, 75)`) removes moire while preserving text edges
- **Otsu threshold** (`cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU`) after bilateral — auto-determines optimal binary threshold
- **PSM 4** (single column variable text) for terminal screens — NOT PSM 6 (single uniform block) which was the research recommendation but fails in practice
- **Do NOT use `fix_rotation()` (Tesseract OSD) on phone photos** — EXIF transpose handles rotation. OSD on raw phone images often fails and the 270° fallback rotates correct images sideways

### Probate Deep Prospecting (from courthouse terminals)

Courthouse probate records have decedent name + PR/executor name but NO property address. Multi-tier lookup fills the gap:

**Property Address Lookup** (Step 3c in enrichment pipeline):
1. **Tier 1: Knox Tax API name search** — search `/parcels/{decedent_name}`, score by token overlap (FIRST MIDDLE LAST → LAST FIRST MIDDLE), accept >= 0.4 match. Tries multiple name variations (with/without suffix, LAST FIRST format, first+last only).
2. **Tier 2: Executor family search** — search Knox Tax API by executor name, look for properties where decedent's last name appears in owner field (family property transferred to executor).
3. **Tier 3: People search** — search TruePeopleSearch/FastPeopleSearch for decedent's last known Knox County address.

**Probate Preset** (obituary enricher):
- Triggers when court record has PR name + decedent name (no address required) — prevents wrong obituary from overriding court-named executor
- Sets DM = the named PR/executor directly, skips obituary search entirely
- Then runs DM address lookup (Knox Tax API → People Search → Tracerfy)

**DOD Sanity Check** (obituary enricher):
- Rejects obituary matches where DOD is > 3 years before the notice **publication** date (`MAX_DOD_GAP_YEARS = 3`)
- Prevents matching a 2014 obituary to a 2025 court filing (wrong person with same name)
- Applied to both full-page and snippet matches
- Anchors on `date_published` (the legal publication date), falling back to `date_added` — NOT `date_added` alone, which is now the run date (see "Date Semantics" under Output)

### Deceased-Owner Heir Resolution — Enformion (opt-in, build 1.0.30+)

The default obituary path extracts survivors/heirs from obituary text with an LLM, which can hallucinate an entire heir map (see `project_obituary_heir_hallucination` memory). The **Primary Path** of the `deep-prospecting` skill replaces this with the Enformion/Endato relatives graph — grounded, nothing inferred.

- **Module:** `src/enformion_heir.py` — reusable client: `person_search()`, `relatives_to_survivors()`, `required_signers()` (cost gate: living closest-kin `relativeLevel == "ab"` + decedent surname + DOB), `dedupe_phones()`, and `resolve_heirs_enformion(notice, parsed)` which returns `(ranked_dms, error_info)` shaped exactly like `build_heir_map()` so the rest of the pipeline is unchanged. Heir signing authority reuses `obituary_enricher.rank_decision_makers` (TN intestacy).
- **Pipeline (Step A only, 1 call/record):** `python src/main.py daily --deep-heirs`. In `obituary_enricher` Phase B, a new **Path E** runs Enformion FIRST for confirmed-deceased owners that no cheaper high-confidence path resolved (surviving co-owner on title, court-named executor). Falls through to the obituary-survivor waterfall on a miss or when creds are absent. Default (no flag, and the Apify daily Actor) keeps the old behavior — Enformion is never auto-billed.
- **Full waterfall (one record):** `python src/run_deep_prospect.py --first X --last Y --street "..." --city Knoxville --state TN --zip 37917` runs Steps A-E (decedent → required signers → per-signer search → phone dedupe → Trestle scoring) and prints a master dial sheet. Consolidates the one-off `run_brice_*` scripts.
- **Creds:** `ENFORMION_AP_NAME` / `ENFORMION_AP_PASSWORD` in `.env` + `config.py`. Billed per match (~$0.35); misses are free. Detect API failure by HTTP status, NOT the always-present `error` object.
- **DOD conflict:** Enformion's death-index DOD can disagree with the obituary DOD (often a second household death). Surfaced via a `dod_conflict` flag in `missing_data_flags`; never silently resolved.

### Dropbox Folder Structure
```
{DROPBOX_ROOT_FOLDER}/
├── Knox/
│   ├── eviction/
│   ├── code_violation/
│   ├── divorce/
│   ├── foreclosure/
│   ├── tax_sale/
│   └── probate/
└── Blount/
    └── (same subfolders)
```

### Environment Variables
- `DROPBOX_APP_KEY` — Dropbox OAuth2 app key
- `DROPBOX_APP_SECRET` — Dropbox OAuth2 app secret
- `DROPBOX_REFRESH_TOKEN` — Dropbox offline refresh token (auto-rotates access tokens)
- `DROPBOX_POLL_INTERVAL` — seconds between polls (default 900 = 15 min)
- `DROPBOX_ROOT_FOLDER` — root folder path in Dropbox (e.g., "TN Public Notice")

### Dependencies (added to requirements.txt)
- `opencv-python-headless>=4.13.0` — image preprocessing (headless = no GUI, saves 26MB in Docker)
- `numpy>=1.26.0` — required by OpenCV
- `dropbox>=12.0.2` — Dropbox SDK (minimum for post-Jan-2026 API compatibility)

## DataSift.ai (REISift) Integration

DataSift.ai (formerly REISift) is the CRM where scraped records land for niche sequential marketing campaigns. There is **no REST API** — upload is via Playwright browser automation of the web UI.

**Domain:** `app.reisift.io` (NOT `app.datasift.ai`). API at `apiv2.reisift.io`.

### Key Files
- `src/datasift_formatter.py` — Transforms `NoticeData` → DataSift CSV (42 columns)
- `src/datasift_uploader.py` — Playwright login + upload wizard + enrich + skip trace + preset management + sequence builder + SiftMap sold workflow
- `test_datasift_upload.py` — Headed browser test (upload + enrich + skip trace)
- `test_manage_presets.py` — Headed browser test (preset discovery + sold exclusion + sequence creation)
- `test_manage_sold.py` — Headed browser test (SiftMap sold property tagging)

### CSV Column Structure (42 columns)
- **Core auto-mapped (11):** Property Street/City/State/ZIP, Owner First/Last Name, Mailing Street/City/State/ZIP, Tags
- **Lists + Notes (2):** Lists (for niche sequential), Notes (contextual per notice type)
- **Built-in fields (13):** Estimated Value, MSL Status, Last Sale Date/Price, Equity Percentage, Tax Deliquent Value, Tax Delinquent Year, Tax Auction Date, Foreclosure Date, Probate Open Date, Personal Representative, Parcel ID, Structure Type, Year Built, Living SqFt, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Lot (Acres)
- **Custom fields (16):** Notice Type, County, Date Added, Owner Deceased, Date of Death, Decedent Name, Decision Maker, DM Relationship, DM Confidence, DM 2/3 Name/Relationship, Obituary URL, Source URL, Notice Screenshot

### Niche Sequential Marketing
DataSift's niche sequential system uses filter presets to guide records through SMS → Call → Mail → Deep Prospecting phases. Two preset folders: "00 Niche Sequential Marketing" (12 presets, courthouse data) and "01. Bulk Sequential Marketing" (9 presets, bulk data). All 21 presets exclude Sold status (build 1.0.23). A "Sold Property Cleanup" sequence in the Transactions folder auto-fires on "Sold" tag to change status, remove from lists, clear tasks, and clear assignee.

- **"Courthouse Data" tag:** Every record gets this tag — signals first-to-market county data (prioritized over bulk data in filter presets)
- **Lists column:** Maps `notice_type` → DataSift list name (`foreclosure` → "Foreclosure", `probate` → "Probate", `tax_sale` → "Tax Sale", `tax_delinquent` → "Tax Delinquent", `eviction` → "Eviction", `code_violation` → "Code Violation", `divorce` → "Divorce"). DataSift auto-creates lists from CSV.
- **Tags:** Courthouse Data, notice_type, county, YYYY-MM date, deceased/living, DM confidence level, has_auction, tax_delinquent, photo_import (for photo-sourced records)

### Upload Wizard (5 Steps)
1. **Setup:** Click "Upload File" sidebar → "Add Data" → dropdown "Uploading a new list not in DataSift yet" → enter list name → organization questions
2. **Tags:** Skip through (tags are in CSV column)
3. **Upload File:** Set file on `input[type="file"]`
4. **Map Columns:** Core address fields auto-map; Tags, Lists, and enrichment columns may need manual mapping
5. **Review + Finish Upload:** Click "Finish Upload" — processing happens in background

### Column Mapping Notes
- Only core address fields (Property Street, City, State, ZIP) reliably auto-map
- Tags, Lists, Estimated Value, and enrichment columns often stay unmapped in step 4
- Notes and MSL Status sometimes auto-map
- Custom fields (TN Public Notice group) require drag-and-drop mapping

### Contact Logic
- **Deceased owners:** Contact = decision maker (first/last name + mailing address from DM)
- **Living owners:** Contact = property owner (owner mailing address, falls back to property address)

### Post-Upload: Enrich + Skip Trace

After CSV upload, the pipeline automatically runs two DataSift actions via Playwright:

1. **Enrich Property Information** (Manage → Enrich Data): Adds SiftMap property data (beds, baths, Zestimate, sqft, sale history) to uploaded records. "Enrich Owners" and "Swap Owners" are OFF — protects our PR/DM contact mapping.
2. **Skip Trace** (Send To → Skip Trace): Pulls phone numbers (up to 5 per owner) + emails via unlimited plan ($97/mo). Adds auto-tag `skip_traced_YYYY-MM`.

Both run in background — tracked in Activity tab. Both are ON by default when `--upload-datasift` is set.

### CLI Flags
```bash
python src/main.py daily --upload-datasift        # upload + enrich + skip trace
python src/main.py daily --upload-datasift --no-enrich       # upload only, skip enrichment
python src/main.py daily --upload-datasift --no-skip-trace   # upload + enrich, skip skip trace
python src/main.py daily --notify-slack            # send run summary to Slack/Discord
python src/main.py daily --deep-heirs               # resolve deceased-owner heirs via Enformion (~$0.35/match)
```

### Environment Variables
- `DATASIFT_EMAIL` — DataSift login email
- `DATASIFT_PASSWORD` — DataSift login password
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` — Slack/Discord webhook for run summaries

### Login Selectors (SPA quirks)
- Hidden checkboxes (Remember me, Terms) — click `<label>` elements, not `<input>`
- Use `wait_until="domcontentloaded"` (not `networkidle` — SPA keeps WebSocket connections open)
- Cookie validation: check for `/dashboard` or `/records` in URL (5s wait for SPA redirect)

### DataSift UI Automation Patterns

Hard-won patterns from build 1.0.22-1.0.23 (SiftMap, preset management, sequence builder). Follow these to avoid repeating past mistakes.

**Styled-Components (no native HTML controls)**
- No native `<select>` elements — all dropdowns are `[class*="Selectstyles__Select"]` containers
- `[class*="SelectValue"]` = current value display; `[class*="SelectOptionContainer"]` = dropdown options
- Multiple Select dropdowns exist per panel (Lists, Tags, Property Status) — always target the **LAST visible one**
- Use `x > 450` bounds check in all JS queries to avoid matching sidebar elements (sidebar is 0-400px)
- React state updates require native setter + event dispatch, not just `.value = ...`:
  ```js
  const setter = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(window.HTMLInputElement.prototype, 'value').set;
  setter.call(input, 'new value');
  input.dispatchEvent(new Event('input', {bubbles: true}));
  input.dispatchEvent(new Event('change', {bubbles: true}));
  ```

**Panel Scrolling (Playwright scroll fails)**
- Filter panel is a scrollable `<div>`, NOT the viewport — `scroll_into_view_if_needed()` does nothing
- Use JS: `el.scrollIntoView({behavior: 'instant', block: 'center'})` instead
- Filter Presets section is at the BOTTOM of the filter panel — must scroll container down to reveal
- After scrollIntoView, element y-positions may be negative — don't filter by `y > 0` for the target element

**React DnD (Sequence Builder)**
- Cards have `draggable="false"` — Playwright's native drag won't work
- Must use slow mouse drag: `mouse.move()` → `mouse.down()` → 20 incremental steps (50ms each) → `mouse.up()`
- Add 500ms pauses between down/move/up phases
- "Add new Action +" button required for 2nd+ actions; first action uses initial drop zone
- Sidebar cards can scroll out of view when main area scrolls — scroll BOTH source and target into view before drag

**Pointer Interception (common blockers)**
- Beamer NPS survey iframe (`#npsIframeContainer`) blocks ALL pointer events globally — remove from DOM via `_dismiss_popups()`
- `RecordsFiltersstyles__RecordsFiltersSection` elements intercept clicks — use `page.evaluate()` JS click or `force=True`
- When Playwright click fails with "outside of viewport" or "intercept": switch to `page.evaluate(el => el.click())`
- SiftMap PropertyDetails panel blocks sidebar checkboxes — remove from DOM before interactions

**Preset Management Workflow**
- Flow: open filter panel → scroll to bottom → expand "Filter Presets" → expand folder → click preset → modify → Save (not Save New) → confirm overwrite
- Folder names have case variations ("00 Niche" vs "00 NICHE") — use `.toUpperCase()` comparison
- Preset names follow pattern `^\d{2}\.` (e.g., "00. Needs Skipped")
- 2 folders: "00 Niche Sequential Marketing" (12 presets), "01. Bulk Sequential Marketing" (9 presets)
- All 21 presets have Property Status "Do not include" → "Sold" (build 1.0.23)

**Sequence Builder Workflow**
- Flow: `/sequences` → Create → title + folder → drag trigger → condition → actions tab → drag actions → configure → save
- Duplicate name handling: detect error toast "different sequence title", retry with " V2" suffix
- Actions tab: navigate via "Set the Following Actions" button or URL (`/sequences/new/actions`)
- Autocomplete inputs: after each selection, `fill("")` + Escape to dismiss dropdown before next entry
- "Sold Property Cleanup" sequence exists in Transactions folder (build 1.0.23): Trigger (Property Tags Added) → Condition (Sold) → Actions (Status→Sold, Remove Lists, Clear Tasks, Clear Assignee)

**SiftMap Automation**
- Search by city (NOT county): Knox → "Knoxville, TN", Blount → "Maryville, TN"
- PropertyDetails panel auto-opens on search — remove from DOM before other interactions
- "Add Records to Account" modal: toggle OFF "Do not replace owners", add tags, dismiss dropdown by clicking heading (NOT Escape — clears tags)
- Known limitation: SiftMap filters (price, date) set values visually but don't trigger React re-query. Only sidebar-visible properties (~3-5) get added per run

**Market Finder Extraction Patterns (build 1.0.29+)**

Hard-won patterns from building `extract_market_finder.py`. The Market Finder UI differs significantly from the rest of DataSift.

- **NO HTML `<table>` element** — data table is entirely div-based: `Tablestyles__TableContainer` → `TableRow` → `TableCell` (styled-components). Searching for `<table>` or `<tr>/<td>` finds nothing.
- **PAGINATION, not infinite scroll** — table shows 20 rows per page with "1-20 of N" text and `PaginationInnerContainer` with prev/next `<button>` elements. Must click through ALL pages to get complete data. Knox County has 48 ZIPs (3 pages) and 120+ neighborhoods (7 pages).
- **State/County selection uses `InputMultiSearch`** — NOT styled-component Select dropdowns. Inputs have placeholders: `"Select States"`, `"Select Counties"`, `"Select ZIP Codes"`. Click input → type name → click dropdown result item (`[class*="Item"]:has-text("...")`).
- **ZIP/Neighborhood toggle is a styled Select dropdown** — at the top bar with `Selectstyles__SelectValue` showing current view. Check the displayed text BEFORE clicking — if already on the correct view, clicking toggles AWAY from it. Only click to switch if the displayed text doesn't match the desired view.
- **Beamer push modal (`#beamerPushModal`)** — appears on fresh login, blocks ALL pointer events. Different from the NPS survey (`#npsIframeContainer`). Both must be removed from DOM before any click interactions. Always call dismiss with `force=True` as fallback.
- **Page body scrolling required** — pagination controls are at `y=1867`, below the viewport (`clientH=824`). Must scroll `AdminPage__AdminPageBody` container down before pagination buttons are accessible.
- **Summary panel on right side** — shows county-level aggregates: Median Home Value, Homes on Market, Mo. Investor Transactions, Homes Sold Last Month, Market Rent, Gross Rental Yield, Homeownership Rate. Extract via regex on page text.

```bash
# Extract all Market Finder data for a county
python src/extract_market_finder.py --state "Tennessee" --county "Knox" -v
python src/extract_market_finder.py --state "Tennessee" --county "Knox,Blount" --headless

# Output: JSON file in output/market_finder_{state}_{county}_{timestamp}.json
```

### Key Corrections Made During Optimization (April 2026)
- **Hardcoded credentials removed** from sift-market-research (had email/password in SKILL.md)
- **Bedroom adjustment corrected** from $10K to $5K in real-estate-comping (matched to `comp_analyzer.py`)
- **HML points corrected** from 0% to 2% in deal-analyzer (matched to `deal_analyzer.py DEFAULT_HARD_MONEY_POINTS`)
- **Linux paths fixed** in sequential-presets (was `/home/ubuntu/skills/...`, now relative)
- **Preset names aligned** across 3 skills to match `niche_sequential.py` source code
- **Transfer tax labeled** as Tennessee-specific in deal-analyzer with state reference table for top 10 states
- **"Substantial renovation" defined** in real-estate-comping: kitchen + 1 bath minimum (~$15K spend)
